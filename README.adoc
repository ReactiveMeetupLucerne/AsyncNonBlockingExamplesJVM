= Async non-blocking code examples for the JVM

:imagesdir: ./docs

== Introduction

We are a group of software developers with a monthly meetup in https://goo.gl/maps/NpfJhDWsCnw[Lucerne (Switzerland)].
We are interested in programming questions around concurrency, distributed systems, consistency...

We are learning new ways how to write code that scales up (vertically) and out (horizontally).
There are many technologies out there today (libraries, languages, ...), most of them are "pretty new".
Some work well for *scaling up* (RxJava, akka-stream, CompletableFuture, ...), others for *scaling out* (Vert.x, Hazelcast, akka, ...).
Some of them seem to be good for scaling up *and* out (Vert.x, akka, ...).

A typical core characteristic of these languages and libraries is the "async and non-blocking" working manner.

To get used to "async and non-blocking" and the various technologies we defined a couple of "simple" coding challenges.
We try now to implement them and share the solutions.

Have fun in comparing the results and feel free to provide feedback, improvements or contributions via GitHub issues and pull requests.

Sincerly, +
the participating members of the https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Luzern-reactive-concurrent-distributed-solutions-on-the-JVM/[Lucerne reactive meetup group]


== Async non-blocking coding challenges

Rules

* All examples *must* be implemented without blocking threads
** except: it's ok to block the main thread to keep the JVM alive until the example completed

=== Challenge 1: combining the results of "parallel" calls

....

                [PriceService1::getPrice]

                          &&

[avg price?] -> [PriceService2::getPrice] -> [println avg price]

                          &&

                [PriceService3::getPrice]


....

Because the link:./src/main/java/externalLegacyCodeNotUnderOurControl/PriceService.java[price services] in this challenge are "slow", it's a good idea to call them "in parallel" and combine afterwards the results.
It's important to not block the "avg price?" caller and to do the calculation of the average price asynchronously.

Credits go to https://github.com/christophsuter for his "concurrency notation".

=== Challenge 2: fallback in case of timeout

....

                      [PriceService::getPrice ... ... ... ... ... ... ]

[current price?] ->             ||      -> [println price or fallback value]

                             [timeout]

....

Sometimes things don't work as expected. In this challenge here the link:./src/main/java/externalLegacyCodeNotUnderOurControl/PriceService.java[price service] is extra slow and "takes forever"
to deliver the price. Because we can't fix the price service we use instead a fallback mechanism to keep our code "responsive":
If the price service doesn't answer within 2 seconds, we provide a fallback value of `42`.

Don't forget to "cancel" the price service in case of timeouts.

=== Challenge 3: stream of temperature values

....


[T1] ... [T2] ... [T3] ... [T4] ... [T5] ... [T6] ... [T7] ... [T8] ... [T9] ...

                                   \                                         \
                                    -> [println min max]                      -> [println min max]

....

We have a link:./src/main/java/externalLegacyCodeNotUnderOurControl/TemperatureValueSource.java[source of data].
It pushes every 2 seconds a new value `Tx` (the current temperature) to its observers.
We have one observer which prints out every 10 seconds the min and the max temperature.

=== Challenge 4: request collapsing

....

        [current price?] ->                    -> [println price]
                            \                /

[current price?] -> [PriceService1::getPrice]  -> [println price]


....

Because calls to our link:./src/main/java/externalLegacyCodeNotUnderOurControl/PriceService.java[price service]
are "expensive", we'd like to "collapse" concurrent requests. This is a little bit like caching, but instead
of just sharing the results we share the ongoing calculation of a result.
